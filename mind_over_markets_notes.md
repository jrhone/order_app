Which way is the market trying to go?
and
Is it doing a good job in its attempt to go that way?


movie idea:
- nomadic world traveller adventuring lands and finding himmself on the road
- bourne ultimatum directorial style for speed and flash
- fear and loathing style for kooky
- something for funny
- something for human connection
